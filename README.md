# Linear-Regression-
* The goal is to perform an evaluation of Microsuturing which is a surgical technique of stitching under a microscope.
* Implementation of the gradient descent algorithm on mean squared error (MSE) loss to find linear regression parameters.
* Also includes implementation of OVA (One-vs-All) classifier for multiclass classification built on linear regression.
* Refer to `report.pdf` for more implementation details and analysis
